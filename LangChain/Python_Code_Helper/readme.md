Using LangChain and Ollama local models Built a Simple Autonomous Agent.

The Autonomous Code Helper Agent is a tool designed to assist developers in analyzing and improving Python code. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to provide analysis and suggestions for fixing errors in Python code snippets. The agent is capable of identifying syntax errors, providing detailed analysis of code issues, and suggesting fixes to enhance code readability and correctness.

The agent is deployed as a web application using the Flask framework. It provides a user-friendly interface for developers to input Python code snippets and receive analysis results and suggestions in real-time.
