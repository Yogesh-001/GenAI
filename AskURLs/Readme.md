This Project is about building a chatbot that uses LLMs to answer questions based on user-provided URLs.

## Features

- **URL Fetching**: Fetches HTML content from multiple URLs.
- **Text Chunking**: Divides large text into smaller, meaningful chunks.
- **Vector Store**: Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to store and search text chunks.
- **Customizable LLMs**: Works with Llama 3.1 (or other Hugging Face models).
