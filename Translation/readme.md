# Language Translation with Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune and use the `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr` model for English-to-French translation. The model is based on the MarianMT architecture and is part of the `transformers` library by Hugging Face.

## Project Overview

In this project, we focus on using the pre-trained `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr` model to translate English sentences into French. Additionally, we fine-tune the model on a parallel English-French dataset to improve its translation performance.

### Key Features:
- **Model:** Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr
- **Task:** English-to-French Translation
- **Framework:** Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets
- **Evaluation Metric:** BLEU score
